//! - `bandwidth`: equivalent-time folding of periodic signals (also above Nyquist), step response -> rise time and
//!   magnitude response (front-end bandwidth test)
//! - `edges`: comparator with hysteresis -> edge list with interpolated times (the base of all triggers)
//! - `trigger`: software trigger types of a modern scope (edge, pulse, slope, video, pattern, duration, timeout, runt,
//!   window, delay, setup/hold, Nth edge) with time conditions
//! - `measure`: voltage, time and two-channel measurements
//! - `mask`: mask (pass/fail) test: envelope around a reference waveform, records tested against it
//! - `expr`: math expressions over the channels
//! - `math`: arithmetic, integral, derivative, filters, FFT with windows
//! - `magnetic`: inductance, B/H/μr, core loss and the I vs ∫V loop
//! - `sim`: signal generators for tests and the demo source (pulse trains with glitches/runts, composite video, ...)
//!
//! Waveforms are `&[f32]` volts sampled every `dt` seconds; times inside a waveform are fractional sample indices.

/// Analog channels the triggers and the expressions take. A board with more needs them extended here.
